### Changed

- Filtering out yaml files from the dockerfile sources since all three dockerfile linters
  use yaml files as their configuration files. (#12)

### Fixed

- Changing dockerfilelint rc file to an empty file since dockerfilelint doesn't handle an empty rules list. (#11)

  the output from its tool. (#11)
